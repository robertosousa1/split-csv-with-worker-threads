To perform a simulation of receiving and storing data in a NoSQL database,
a distributed system is implemented that, from the execution of a master process, another child process is executed.

The child process reads a text file, each line is composed of 8 fields.

After reading the file and storing it in main memory, the child process triggers n threads (consider n = 10 for your tests).

Each thread, executes in parallel, obtaining a fraction of lines and writes to a text file, whose name must be its ID, (simulating the sending of this data to a repository
NoSQL in parallel and distributed form).

As soon as the processes are synchronized, the child process ends and the parent process writes an empty text file called DONE.txt
